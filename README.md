# Lap 4 Project

### Installation

- Cd into relevant folder.
- run `pipenv install`.
- run `pipenv shell`.

### Usage

- Inside of the pipenv shell, cd into mainapp.
- run `python manage.py runserver` and open the link in the terminal.
- Enter the URL you would like to shorten in the box provided.
- Copy and paste the provided shortened url into the page search bar.
- Hit enter to be redirected to the page of the original URL you provided!

## Bugs

- Not sure why the shortened link isn't immediately clickable without having to copy and paste it into search bar.

## Future features

- Delpoyment.
- There is a very very small percentage chance that two generated short url's can be the same, haven't added a function to check for this possibility at the moment.
